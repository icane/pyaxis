=======

**pyaxis** is a python library for **PC-Axis (or PX)** formatted data manipulation
which allows reading and writing PC-Axis [1]_ format with python, using the
DataFrame structures provided by the widely accepted pandas library [2]_.
PX is a standard format for statistical files used by a large number of
statistical offices (Spain, Switzerland, Sweden). A package of software has been developed for this format: 
PX-Win, PX-Web and PX-Edit. **pyaxis** eases reading and parsing of PX files data 
and metadata into a pandas Dataframe and a dict structure, allowing their manipulation
in a tabular and pythonic manner. It supports both monolingual and multilingual PX files. The package was initially developped by the [Instituto CÃ¡ntabro de Estadistica](https://www.icane.es) and is now jointly maintained by ICANE and the [Swiss Data Science Center](https://datascience.ch).  
**pyaxis** is provided under the Apache License 2.0.

Installation
============

For installation::

    pip install pyaxis

Usage
=====

From PX to pandas DataFrame
-----------------------------------

Typical usage often looks like this::

    from pyaxis import pyaxis

    EXAMPLE_URL = 'https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/files/t/es/px/2184.px'
    
    px = pyaxis.parse(EXAMPLE_URL, encoding='ISO-8859-2')
    print(px['DATA'])
    print(px['METADATA'])

For Multilingual PX files
-----------------------------------

Typical usage often looks like this::

    from pyaxis import pyaxis

    EXAMPLE_URL = 'https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/DownloadFile.aspx?file=px-x-0602000000_107'
    
    # Swiss PX files are in German(de), French(fr), Italian(it), and English(en)
    px = pyaxis.parse(EXAMPLE_URL, encoding='ISO-8859-2', lang='fr')
    print(px['DATA'])
    print(px['METADATA'])
    print(px['TRANSLATION'])
