pyaxis
=======

**pyaxis** is a python library for **PC-Axis (or PX)** formatted data manipulation
which allows reading and writing PC-Axis [1]_ format with python, using the
DataFrame structures provided by the widely accepted pandas library [2]_.
PX is a standard format for statistical files used by a large number of
statistical offices. A package of software has been developed for this format: 
PX-Win, PX-Web and PX-Edit. **pyaxis** eases reading and parsing of PX files data 
and metadata into a pandas Dataframe and a dict structure, allowing their manipulation
in a tabular and pythonic manner.
**pyaxis** is provided under the Apache License 2.0.
